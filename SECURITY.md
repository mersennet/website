# Security policy

Mersennet runs a public testnet with real users, so please treat findings as
you would on a production network.

**Report privately** to **security@mersennet.com**, or use GitHub's private
vulnerability reporting on this repository (Security tab → *Report a
vulnerability*); either way it reaches the same people. If you need another
channel, ask an admin in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/Mersennet). Include steps
to reproduce, the affected component (node, precompile, terminal, API,
explorer, faucet, SDK) and, for chain issues, the block height. Every public
hostname publishes the same contact at `/.well-known/security.txt`.

- We acknowledge within **48 hours** and keep you informed until the fix ships.
- Credit in the changelog is yours if you want it.
- Please do not test against other users' funds or run denial-of-service
  traffic against the public infrastructure.
- Coordinated disclosure: we ask for up to 90 days before publication for
  consensus-affecting issues, less for everything else.

Supported: the current signed release published at
[mersennet.com/downloads](https://mersennet.com/downloads/). Older builds are
not patched; upgrading is the one-line installer.
